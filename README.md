# Node.js asynchronous ES6/ES7 concepts (basics)

A little guide with testable examples to start learning Javascript promises, generators and async/await, focusing on the Node.js ecosystem.

This guide was written with the intention to introduce some of the above mentioned concepts, showing practical example with explanations.

**Strongy** inspired on the excelent [Ponyfoo](https://ponyfoo.com) series:

- [ES6 Promises in depth](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-promises-in-depth#what-is-a-promise)

- [ES6 Generators in depth](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-generators-in-depth)

- [Understanding JavaScriptâ€™s async await](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/asynchronous-i-o-with-generators-and-promises)

## Installation

To test the examples, after clone the repository, you just have to install the dependencies.

```sh
$ npm install
```

After that, just go through the modules - that are separeted by topic; one for each already mentioned concept, and execute the file that you want to
test the outputs.
